            	<h1>Welcome to LoanZapper</h1>
            	<p>Our app is meant to be a toolkit to help you reduce the amount of interest paid over the life of a loan.</p>
            	<p>This is achieved by making additional principal payments, above your normal principal and interest payment.</p>
            	<p>One of the most important rules to follow when paying additional principal payments on your loan, is that you must pay them after you have made your normal payment, and you must pay them separately.</p>
            	<h2>Setting Up An Account</h2>
            	<p><b>Account Title:</b> This is a name you give the account to identify it. An example is <b><i>"Home Mortgage"</i></b>, or <b><i>"Bank One Home Mortgage"</i></b></p>
            	<p><b>Account Number:</b> This is the account number on your loan. This will be used for the recording of payments and to identify the Online on your payment coupons.</p>
            	<p><b>Loan Amount:</b> The original amount of the loan.</p>
            	<p><b>Start Date:</b> This is the date of your <b><u>first loan payment.</u></b></p>
            	<p><b>Due Date:</b> The day of the month your loan payment is due.</p>
            	<p><b>Loan Term:</b> The number of months of your loan.</p>
				<p><b>Interest Rate:</b> The interest rate on your loan. This should be entered as a whole number, ie. 3.5</p>
            	<hr>
            	<h2>Recording A Payment</h2>
            	<p>When you record a payment, it is entered into your amortization table and calculates the savings made from the principal payment. You may also download and print a payment coupon to send with your payment at http://myloanzapper.com/dashboard/coupon.</p>
            	<hr>
            	<h2>Adding Additional Accounts</h2>
            	<p>Your download includes one loan account. If you want to add aditional accounts you may subscribe for $4.99 per month by <a href="#" class="upgradeAcctBtn2">clicking here.</a></p>
